# Assignment

## Python codes:
This folder contains the following codes in python:
1) Merge sort code
2) Depth First search for Graphs

## TicTacToe:
This folder contains the raw ReactJS app of Tic Tac Toe. You might wanna use 'npm install' before you start the development server( using 'npm start' ).

## How it differs from the ReactJS tutorial?
* The original tutorial did not have a player name validation.
* The app only allows the user(s) to play the game only if both names are entered.
* UI is designed and reworked with module.css classes.
  *  Highlighting the player name conditionally based on their turns
  *  Adding Reset Board and Reset Game buttons to refresh the state.

# Here's a demo of how the app works:
## The player Name validation:
